            <li>If looking at just the bus routes, and not the actual journeys, this gesture will go into a
                mode where you are viewing only buses on that route, or
                just the paths of the route if there are no buses.
                The map will center on the extent of the paths on the route,
                trying to encompass them all in a single view.
            </li>
            <li>If looking at just buses on a single route, this gesture will go into a mode where you are looking at only the
                bus you selected, as if you single tapped on its blip. (see above).
            </li>
            <li>If you are looking at only one bus that is green, this gesture will center the map on the current location of
                the bus.

    <dt>The Back Button</dt>
    <dd>The Back Button is used to back out of your various bus selections. Usually you start in SHOW_ALL,
        which shows all the routes and buses, but only the route names.  After a single ta on the Routes List, you
        progress to SHOW_ROUTE, which shows just the paths and buses of a
        single route, If you tap on the routes list again on a particular line you progress to SHOW_VEHICLE, which is
        just displaying a single bus, in which its path and blip are in green. You may make different bus selections
        in between based on a single tap on the map that may exclude some routes.These selections stack up in such a way
        that you may use the back button to get back to a previous selection.
