<h1>Creating a Busme! Transit Site</h1>
<p>
    Creating a Busme! Transit site is the first operation you need to do. Before you can create
    a Busme! Transit Site, you first need to <a href="/help/creating-an-account">create an account</a>
    using your email. One you have that, and you have successfully logged in, then may you click to
    <a href="/websites/my_index">My Sites</a>&gt;<a href="/websites/new">New Site</a>. Unless approved
    by us, you will only be allowed to create 2 sites.
</p>
<h2>What comprises a Busme! Transit Site</h2>
<p>
    When you create a new Busme! Transit Site, you must enter in some identifying information for
    your transit site. You will be given a form to fill in certain information and a map. The map
    is used to place an icon pointer to specify the default location of your system. Usually, you may
    select the center of town or where you believe the center of the area of your route coverage
    will be.
</p>
<p>
    NOTE: Your browser may ask you to allow it to use your computer's location. If you allow it,
    the map will zoom into your location as it assumes you are probably setting up a system where
    you are. You can, of course, change that.
</p>
<p>
    Once you select a location, the page will fill in the Longitude and Latitude of your placement,
    and attempt to select the correct time zone for the area.
</p>
<h2>Input Fields</h2>
<dl>
    <dt>
        Name
    </dt>
    <dd>
        This field should contain the name of your installation. We would like you to follow
        some standard in setting this name, but we are not enforcing that. We would like you to use:
        "agency, city, state" as a name, such as "NPLoop, New Paltz, NY"</dd>
    <dt>
        http://sites.busme.us
    </dt>
    <dd>
        This field contains the url at which your site will be accessible. It can be anything
        that are small characters and dashs. It will be converted from the Name field, but can
        be changed. For instance "NPLoop, New Paltz, NY" will be "nploop-new-paltz-ny"</dd>
    <dt>
        Longitude
    </dt>
    <dd>
        This contains the Longitude of the default location. It will be filled in upon placing or
        moving the icon on the map.
    </dd>
    <dt>
        Latitude
    </dt>
    <dd>
        This contains the Latitude of the default location. It will be filled in upon placing or
        moving the icon on the map.
    </dd>
    <dt>
        Time Zone
    </dt>
    <dd>
        This contains the time zone of the area. An attempt to find the correct time zone will be
        performed when you move the location icon. However, due to some service restrictions on the
        provider of that information, it may not work. If it did not work, it will say "Africa/Adbidjan",
        which is the first selection. If it did not select the correct one for your area, please select
        it manually.
    </dd>
    <dt>
        Date Format
    </dt>
    <dd>
        This selects the Date Format you would like to use. You can choose from YYYY-MM-DD, DD/MM/YYYY,
        or MM/DD/YYYY. Dates are usually displayed only in the logs, as most of our displays
        are visual and map related for the current day. However, this setting also governs the interpretation
        of your input data should you use MM/DD/YYYY or DD/MM/YYY in your schedule files. In any case,
        if you use YYYY-MM-DD format for your dates, they will be correctly interpreted regardless of
        this setting.
    </dd>
    <dt>
        Description
    </dt>
    <dd>
        You may enter a short description. This text will be only displayed in a list of Busme! Transit Sites.

<h3>Create Your Site</h3>
<p>
    You create your site by hitting the <span class="btn btn-mini">Create</span> button. At this point
    our system must set your site up, and you will be given a spinner and a progress bar.
    It may take a few minutes, depending upon load, or queued wait times. Your browser may time out if it
    the process is taking too long. It only times out that you do not believe that you are hung up. You
    may reload your "My Sites" and it should appear there when it is ready.
</p>
<p>
    After your site is created, you may be taken into your site's administration page. You will be automatically
    signed in, and you will have the Roles of "Super", "Planner", and "Operator". From here, you may start to
    use the <em>Journey Builder</em> tool, download your CSV files, fill in the schedules, and upload your
    plan files, and activate your installation, which exposes it to the public.
</p>
<p>
    In order to understand the layout of the administration page, you must understand the structure of a
    Busme! Transit Site, and the management of it <a href="/help/creating-a-site/mangement">here</a>.
