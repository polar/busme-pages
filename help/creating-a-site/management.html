<h1>Busme! Transit Site Administration</h1>
<p>
    If you are logged into your Busme! Transit site, you may get there by your URL. If you
    have the roles of a "Super", "Planner", or "Operator", you will see an <u>Admin</u> link in the
    upper right navigation section of the page header.
    That link will bring you to the front page of the Adminstration console for your site.

    From there you will see certain information about your Busme! Transit site, which is the
    information you entered when you created the site, such as the Name, default Location, Time Zone,
    Date Format, Description, and the name of the Owner of the site.
    This page will also give you a link to change that information, and will give you a link to the list of
    Deployments your site contains.
</p>
<p>
    A Deployment is a unit of management. Deployments may be "activated"
    to be the published system or in a testing mode The console will tell you what, if any, deployments
    have been activated or activated for testing. A description of being activated follows below. But first
    some explanation of Deployments and Networks is warranted.
</p>
<H2>Administration Structure</h2>
<p>
    A Busme! Transit Site has a particular structure that fosters the ability to have its management handled
    by several people simultaneously. Getting routes drawn
    and schedules filled can take a lot of time. That task for an entire bus system may be done
    faster by using the <em>divide and conquer</em> method of that task with several planners.
</p>
<p>
    The top level management component is a Deployment. Under a Deployment, exists a collection
    of entities called Networks. The Deployment and Network are the main components that comprise the management
    of a Busme! Transit Site.
</p>
<h3>Deployment</h3>
<p>
    To help facilitate management of a Busme! Transit site, the site is divvied up into a
    a number of top level components called a Deployments.
</p>
<p>
    A Deployment is a grouping entity that comprises
    the entire routes and schedule that may activated. When you "activate" a Deployment
    you "run" the system simulation. Running a system simulation means that your site is
    able to collect posted locations from the Busme! Mobile App, and your system appears
    as running on its public facing page.
</p>
<p>
    You maintain ceployments to serve as different schedule designations. For example, you
    may have deployments entitled "Normal" and "Snow Day", each which contains the routes and
    schedule for every day, and possibly different routes and/or schedules for and
    emergency snow service, respectively. This approach allows you to have two valid system
    definitions and activate the one you need with a couple clicks.
</p>
<p>
    You may also use deployments as workspaces. For instance, you may be able to
    activate "Spring 2014" while simultaneously working on Deployment "Fall 2014".
</p>
<p>
    Deployments are owned by people in the Planner role, when they are created by that
    person. An Operator may activate a particular deployment, but not define it or change it.
</p>
<p>
    To help divvy up the workload even more, a Deployment is comprised of Networks, which
    are logical divisions of deployments.
</p>
<p>
    When you create a new Busme! Transit site,
    you are given one Deployment named "Deployment 1" containing one Network, named "Network 1".
    These components are created for you as a convenience, so that you may start defining
    your routes and schedules right away.
</p>
<h3>Network</h3>
<p>
    A Network is just merely a logical division of a Deployment. A Network contains the routes and
    schedules of one or more bus routes. You may also copy a network into another deployment.
    Therefore, you may have two or three people working on different routes in their own
    deployment workspaces, and copy those networks to a deployment that may be activated.
</p>
<p>
    Networks usually represent some section or network of Routes. For instance, you may have
    a Deployment named "Normal" with Networks named "Southbound", "Northbound",
    and "Crosstown".
</p>
<p>
    Working with networks also may speed up the "compiling" process in that you may only
    have to change a few things in your Busme! CSV files for a particular network and
    upload them for processing without having to upload to reprocess the entire deployment.
</p>
<h3>Consistent Deployment</h3>
<p>
    A Deployment may only be activated if it is "consistent". We claim a deployment is "consistent"
    if there are no common routes inside different networks of the Deployment, as that could cause
    conflicts. So, if two different networks within a Deployment contained a Route with the Route Code
    of "240", the Deployment would be inconsistent, and it will not be able to be simulated or
    activated.
</p>
<p>
    Using a Deployment merely as a workspace, you may have a Deployment with many networks
    that have routes in common. However, you will not be able to
    activate it or simulate it.
</p>
<h3>Active Deployment</h3>
<p>
    An Active Deployment is a Deployment that has been Activated. Only one Deployment may be
    activated at a time. When activated, the routes and journeys defined within networks of the deployment
    are simulated on our backend processors. The result is that one may see the vehicle icons moving on the
    screen, and the Busme! Mobile App may post its GPS location on certain vehicles.
</p>
<h3>Testing Deployment</h3>
<p>
    A Testing Deployment is a Deployment that has been activated for testing. Only one Deployment may be
    activated for testing at a time. When activated for testing, the routes and journeys defined within
    networks of the deployment are simulated on our backend processors in testing mode. The result is that
    may see the vehicle icons moving on the screen in the testing page, and the Busme! Mobile App in testing mode
    may post its GPS location on certain vehicles. The Testing Deployment allows you to test certain aspects
    of your system, such as accuracy of travel times, etc without publishing your results to the public.
</p>
<h3>Simulating a Deployment</h3>
<p>
    You have the ability to simulate a deployment, which is running the simulation of your system for your
    viewing only. You can specify a particular date and time, and specify a clock multiplier to run it faster.
    This approach may give you a quick sense if you got your definition of the routes and schedules correct.
</p>
<p>
    This simulating may take up needed resources for your other endeavors such as processing your plan files
    and running your active deployment. You get limited resources for such activities until you upgrade
    your subscription.
