<h1>Busme! Transit Site Administration</h1>
<p>
    A Busme! Transit Site has a particular structure that fosters a management that may be
    handled by several people simultaneously dividing up the work.  Getting routes drawn
    and schedules filled can take some time and it may be done faster by divide and
    conquer of the tasks.
</p>
<h2>Deployments</h2>
<p>
    To help facilitate management of a Busme! Transit site, the site is divvied up into a
    a number of top level components called a "Deployments".
    A "Deployment" is a grouping entity that comprises
    the entire routes and schedule that may activated. When you "activate" a Deployment
    you "run" the system simulation. Running a system simulation means that your site is
    able to collect posted locations from the Busme! Mobile App, and your system appears
    as running on its public facing page.
</p>
<p>
    You maintain Deployments to serve as different schedule designations. For example, you
    may have deployments entitled "Normal" and "Snow Day", which contains the routes and
    schedule for everyday, and possibly different routes and/or schedules for and
    emergency show service, respectively. This approach allows you to have two valid system
    definitions and activate the one you need with a couple clicks.
</p>
<p>
    You may also use Deployments as workspaces. For instance, you may be able to
    activate "Spring 2014" while simultaneously working on Deployment "Fall 2014".
</p>
<p>
    Deployments are owned by people in the Planner role, when they are created by that
    person. An Operator may activate a particular Deployment.
</p>
<p>
    To help divvy up the workload even more, a Deployment is comprised of Networks, which
    are logical divisions of Deployments. When you create a new Busme! Transit site,
    you are given one Deployment named "Deployment 1" containing one Network, named "Network 1".
</p>
<h2>Networks</h2>
<p>
    A Network is just merely a division of a Deployment. A Network contains the routes and
    schedules of one or more bus routes. You may also copy a network into another Deployment.
    Therefore, you may have two or three people working on different routes in their own
    Deployment workspaces, and copy those networks to a Deployment that may be activated.
    Networks usually represent some section or network of Routes. For instance, you may have
    a Deployment named "Normal" with Networks named "Southbound", "Northbound",
    and "Crosstown".
</p>
<p>
    Working with Networks also may speed up the "compiling" process in that you may only
    have to change a few things in your Busme! CSV files for a particular network and
    upload them for processing without having to upload to reprocess the entire Deployment.
</p>
<h2>Consistent Deployment</h2>
<p>
    A Deployment may only be activate if it is "consistent". We claim a deployment is "consistent"
    if there are no common routes within the Networks of the Deployment, as that could cause
    conflicts. So, if two Networks within a Deployment contained a Route with the Route Code
    of "240", the Deployment would be inconsistent, and will not be able to be simulated or
    activated.
</p>
<p>
    Using a Deployment merely as a workspace, you may have a Deployment with many networks
    that have routes in common, using it as a workspace. However, you will not be able to
    activate it or simulate it.
</p>
<h2>Routes</h2>
<p>
    A Route is a definition of a bus line that is associated with some identifying
    Route Code, such as 240, CA1, 345T, etc. Usually, buses on these routes follow a similar
    path. A Route is defined by one or more Busme! CSV files, containing information such
    as the Route Code, and the Service, which is the start and end dates, exception dates, and direction.
    A Route also contains Journeys, which is a list of vehicle paths and times that comprise the route.
</p>
<h2>Journeys</h2>
<p>
    A Journey is the path a vehicle takes and its schedule times. It consists of list of Stop Points,
    the path between the Stop Points and scheduled times a vehicle arrives at each of those stop points.
