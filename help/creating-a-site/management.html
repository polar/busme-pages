<h1>Busme! Transit Site Administration</h1>
<p>
  If you are logged into your Busme! Transit site, you may get there by your URL. If you
  have the roles of a "Super", "Planner", or "Operator", you will see an <u>Admin</u> link in the
  upper right navigation section of the page header.
  That link will bring you to the front page of the Administration console for your site.

  From there you will see certain information about your Busme! Transit site, which is the
  information you entered when you created the site, such as the Name, default Location, Time Zone,
  Date Format, Description, and the name of the Owner of the site.
  This page will also give you a link to change that information, and will give you a link to the list of
  Deployments your site contains.
</p>
<p>
  A Deployment is a unit of management. Deployments may be "activated"
  to be the published system or in a testing mode. The dashboard will tell you if and which deployment
  has been activated or activated for testing. A description of a Deployment being activated follows below.
  However, first we offer an explanation of Deployments and Networks.
</p>
<H2>Administration Structure</h2>
<p>
  A Busme! Transit Site has a particular structure that fosters the ability to have its management handled
  by several people simultaneously. Getting routes drawn
  and schedules filled can take a lot of time. This task for an entire bus system may be done
  faster by using a <em>divide and conquer</em> method of that task with several Planners.
</p>
<p>
  The top level management component is called a Deployment. Under a Deployment, there exists a collection
  of entities called Networks. The Deployment and Network are the main components that comprise the management
  of a Busme! Transit Site. Their respective definitions an purposes are listed below:
</p>
<h3>Deployment</h3>
<p>
  To help facilitate management of a Busme! Transit site, the site is divvied up into a
  a number of top level components called a Deployments.
</p>
<p>
  A Deployment is a grouping entity that comprises
  the entire routes and schedule that may activated for a particular Busme! Transit Site.
  When you "activate" a Deployment you "run" the system simulation.
</p>
<p>
  Running a system simulation means that your site is modeling vehicle locations according to your
  entered schedules. Also, your system is able
  able to collect locations reported from the Busme! Mobile App. Your Busme! Transit system appears
  as running on its public facing page.
</p>
<p>
  You maintain Deployments to serve as different schedule designations. For example, you
  may have deployments entitled "Normal" and "Snow Day", each which contains the routes and
  schedule for every day, and possibly different routes and/or schedules for and
  emergency snow service, respectively. This approach allows your Planners to create two valid system
  definitions, and your Operators to activate the one you need with a couple clicks.
</p>
<p>
  You may also use Deployments as workspaces. For instance, you may be able to
  activate Deployment "Spring 2015", while simultaneously working on Deployment "Fall 2015".  Similarly,
  you might have Deployments owned by other Planners, such as "Marys Space," "Peters Space,", and then you can
  either merge them or select and copy different Networks from other Deployments into them.
</p>
<p>
  Deployments are owned by people in the Planner role, when they are created by that
  person. An Operator may activate a particular deployment, but an Operation may not define it or change it.
</p>
<p>
  To help divvy up the workload even more, a Deployment is comprised of Networks, which
  are logical divisions of Deployments.
</p>
<p>
  When you create a new Busme! Transit site,
  you are given one Deployment named "Deployment 1" containing one Network, named "Network 1".
  These components are created for you as a convenience, so that you may start defining
  your routes and schedules right away. You may change their names, or delete them.
</p>
<h3>Network</h3>
<p>
  A Network is a logical division of a Deployment. A Network contains the routes and
  schedules of one or more bus Routes. You may also copy a Network into another Deployment.
  Therefore, you may have two or three people working on different Routes in their own
  Deployment workspaces, and copy those Networks to a Deployment that may be activated.
</p>
<p>
  Networks usually represent some section or collection of Routes. For instance, you may have
  a Deployment named "Normal" with Networks named "Southbound", "Northside",
  and "Mall Buses".
</p>
<p>
  Working with Networks also may speed up the "compiling" process in that you may only
  have to change a few things in your Busme! CSV files for a particular Network and
  upload them for processing without having to upload to reprocess the entire Deployment.
</p>
<h3>Consistent Deployment</h3>
<p>
  A Deployment may only be activated if it is "consistent". We claim a Deployment is "consistent"
  if there are no common routes inside different Networks of the Deployment, as that could cause
  conflicts. So, if two different Networks within a Deployment contained a Route with the Route Code
  of "240", the Deployment would be inconsistent, and it will not be able to be simulated or
  activated.
</p>
<p>
  You may still use a Deployment merely as a workspace, such that it may be inconsistent. You may have
  a Deployment with many Networks that have routes in common, but, you will not be able to
  activate it or simulate it.
</p>
<h3>Active Deployment</h3>
<p>
  An Active Deployment is a Deployment that has been "activated," which means the system is running the
  simulation for that particular Deployment. Only one Deployment may be
  activated at a time. When activated, the routes and journeys defined within the Networks of the Deployment
  are simulated on our backend processors. When a Deployment becomes the Active Deployment the public
  may see the vehicle icons moving on the screen, and the Busme! Mobile App may reports its GPS location
  for specific vehicles.
</p>
<h3>Testing Deployment</h3>
<p>
  A Testing Deployment is a Deployment that has been activated for testing, which means the system is running
  the simulation for that particular Deployment, only in a testing mode. Only one Deployment may be
  activated for testing at a time. When activated for testing, the routes and journeys defined within
  Networks of the Deployment are simulated on our backend processors. The result is that your Planners
  may only see the vehicle icons moving on the Testing Administration screen. The Busme! Mobile App, when
  in testing mode may report its GPS location for specific vehicles. The Testing Deployment allows you to
  test certain aspects of your system, such as accuracy of travel times, etc. without exposing the
  testing system to the public. It is only available to your Planners.
</p>
<h3>Simulating a Deployment</h3>
<p>
  You have the ability to simulate a Deployment, which is running the simulation of your system for your
  Planner/Operators viewing only. You can specify a particular date and time, and your Planner may specify a
  clock multiplier to run it faster.
  This approach may give your Planner a quick sense if you your definition of the routes and schedules are correct.
</p>
<p>
  NOTE: A simulation takes up needed resources for your other endeavors such as processing your plan files
  and running your Active Deployment. You get limited resources for such activities until you upgrade
  your subscription.
