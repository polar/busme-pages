<h1>Components of a Network</h1>
<p>
    This help page gives you some definitions of some of the terminology that is used to define a Busme!
    Network of Routes.
</p>
<p>
    A Network consists of a collection of Routes. Each Route is a cross section of Services and Journeys.
    A Service represents the Start Date, End Date, Exception Dates, Day Class, which are the days of the week
    that the service is in effect, and the Direction. Each Journey is associated with a particular Route's
    Service.
</p>
<h2>Routes</h2>
<p>
    A Route is a definition of a bus line that is associated with some identifying
    Route Code, such as 240, CA1, 345T, etc. Usually, vehicles on a particular route follow a similar
    path. A Route may have many Service definitions.
</p>
<h2>Service</h2>
<p>
    A Service is a calendar specification. It tells you when the schedule applies, which is between the
    Start Date and End Date. It also says when it is not in effect, which are the Exception Dates. It also
    specifies the Day Class, which is the days of the week that the schedule applies, such as Monday, Wednesday,
    Friday, or Daily. Each Journey is associated with a particular Service of a Route.
</p>
<h2>Journey</h2>
<p>
    A Journey is the path, i.e. Journey Pattern, a vehicle takes and its schedule times during a particular day.
    It consists of list of Stop Points, the path between each of the Stop Points and scheduled times a vehicle arrives
    at each of those Stop Points. It is also associated with a particular Service, which are the dates and days on which
    the Journey will run.
</p>
<h2>Stop Point</h2>
<p>
    A Stop Point is simply a location, (Longitude, Latitude), where a there may be a bus stop. We call them
    Stop Points because given public schedules, most times are associated with a bus stop. However, it may not
    actually be a bus stop, but just a place that the schedule says that the vehicle will be passing at
    a particular time. Sometimes we refer to those points as a Timing Point. For instance,
    a bus that picks up people along a particular route every two blocks just may have not have a schedule
    for each stop, because that would be daunting to the reader, but says that the bus
    passes the corner of Washington St and Salina St at 7:00PM, incidentally where there is no bus stop.
</p>
<p>
    For Busme! when planning the Journey Pattern with the Journey Builder tool, it is not necessary to list
    every bus stop, but only the ones in which there is a time associated on the public schedule.
</p>
<h2>Journey Pattern</h2>
<p>
    A Journey Pattern is a list of Stop Points, and a list of Journey Pattern Links. Each Link specifies the path
    between the Stop Points. A Journey Pattern is represented by a particular style of KML file. A KML File is
    a Google XML standard for representing Graphic and Geographic Data. This file is built by our Journey Builder
    Tool.
</p>
<p>
    A Journey Pattern Timing Link (JPTL) is a Journey Pattern Link with a duration (in minutes) associated
    with, i.e. it takes the specified minutes
    for the vehicle to travel along its path. A Journey consists of start time at the first Stop Point of a
    Journey Pattern and then associating duration times with each of its Journey Pattern Links, making them Journey
    Pattern Timing Links.
