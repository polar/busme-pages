<h1>Time Representation in Busme! CSV Plan Files</h1>
<p>
    Times in Busme! CSV files can be somewhat complex. Strangely enough, its complexity is driven
    by the need for simplicity in how one views time representations. It is also driven by the way
    some spreadsheets display time, and how entering a particular time representation will be immediately
    altered, sometimes annoyingly so, by the spreadsheet program itself. Therefore, we have a number
    of rules that govern how the time is calculated in a Stop Point's time columns and in relation to
    other times in the spreadsheet.
</p>
<h3>Time is in minutes from midnight</h3>
<p>
    Perhaps, the first thing that would be beneficial is for you to understand how the time is represented
    internally, which is really quite simple. A departure/arrival time for a particular Stop Point is
    stored as the number of <em>minutes from midnight</em> of a particular service day. Furthermore, the
    number may be negative (minutes before midnight) and the number may be a floating point number, such
    as 624.5, which would be 624 minutes and 30 seconds after midnight.
    The time in <em>minutes from midnight</em> is interpreted in relation to the particular time zone of
    the Stop Point, if specified, otherwise in the default time zone of the Busme! Transit Site.
</p>
<p>How can the time be negative?</p>
<p>
    In places where buses
    run all night long, the start of a route on a particular day, say Saturday, may actually start late Friday
    night. However, that journey is not a bus that is actually scheduled to run as a Friday bus. It is a
    Saturday bus, and its start time may be 11:30 PM the previous day. Therefore, this particular
    journey's internal start time would be -30.0.
</p>
<p>Can time can be greater than 24 hours?</p>
<p>
    Yes. For example in university areas
    where the Friday bus continues its run into the wee hours of Saturday morning,
    such as 12:30 AM, and 1:00 AM at some stops. These times would be internally represented as
    1470 and 1500 respectively.
</p>
<h3>Entering Time</h3>
<p>
    Entering the time in <em>minutes from midnight</em> may be convenient and accurate. However, looking
    at a public schedule in which time is represented as "02:34 PM" or "14:34", it is hard to convert into
    minutes on the fly and eyeball check it to see if the data entry was typed correctly. Therefore, we accept
    a number of different formats and rules for processing time representations.
</p>
<p>
    One notable problem is that sometimes spreadsheet programs will automatically convert an entered time
    into its default time format. For instance, you may enter a 24 hour time of "15:30" and the spreadsheet will
    immediately change it to "3:30:00 PM". These spontaneous conversions may also be problematic when
    you are trying to enter times that are greater than 24 hours. A spreadsheet program may convert your time
    entered for "25:45" as "01:45" immediately, which looses the connotation of the time being the next day.
</p>
<h4>Entering time as literals</h4>
<p>
    One may solve this problem as just entering all times as literals in the cells. In some spreadsheets,
    you have to do the extra work of remembering to explicitly formatting the cells to be text literals. Alternatively,
    you must enter each time with an explicit tick (') mark in front of the time, and the conversion will not happen.
    Entering "'25:34" will be displayed in the spreadsheet as "25:34".
    With this approach you may represent times are before midnight by using a preceding tilde (~), such as "'~11:30 PM".
    This cell would be parsed as 11:30 PM, but because of the tilde(~) it signifies the previous day, which would be
    calculated as 1410 - 1440 = -30.  However, in a spreadsheet, a literal is not a time, and will not be interpreted
    as such in a spreadsheet. Unfortunately, entering time as literals eliminates some nifty stuff you
    can do with spreadsheets, like using TIME formulas.
</p>
<h4>Using TIME Formulas</h4>
<p>
    Some spreadsheets allow you to use formulas on time. One we like is going across a number of cells horizontally
    given that going from one Stop Point to the next would take a specified duration. For example.
</p>
<table class="table table-bordered">
    <tbody>
    <tr>
        <th></th>
        <th>A</th>
        <th>B</th>
        <th>C</th>
        <th>D</th>
        <th>E</th>
        <th>F</th>
        <th>G</th>
        <th>H</th>
        <th>I</th>
        <th>J</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <th>7</th>
        <td>Stop Points</td>
        <td>Days</td>
        <td>Display Name</td>
        <td>VID</td>
        <td>College Place</td>
        <td>Manley North</td>
        <td>Manley South</td>
        <td>GoldStein Center</td>
        <td>NOTE</td>
        <td>file:nob-hill.kml</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <th>8</th>
        <td>240</td>
        <td>MWF</td>
        <td>Nob Hill</td>
        <td>VID</td>
        <td>07:30:00 AM</td>
        <td>=E8+TIME(0,10,0)</td>
        <td>=F8+TIME(0,2,0)</td>
        <td>=G8+TIME(0,8,0)</td>
        <td></td>
        <td></td>
    </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>
<p>
    This formula would make row 8 to look like:
</p>
<table class="table table-bordered">
    <tbody>
    <tr>
        <th></th>
        <th>A</th>
        <th>B</th>
        <th>C</th>
        <th>D</th>
        <th>E</th>
        <th>F</th>
        <th>G</th>
        <th>H</th>
        <th>I</th>
        <th>J</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <th>8</th>
        <td>240</td>
        <td>MWF</td>
        <td>Nob Hill</td>
        <td>VID</td>
        <td>07:30:00 AM</td>
        <td>07:40:00 AM</td>
        <td>07:42:00 AM</td>
        <td>07:50:00 AM</td>
        <td></td>
        <td></td>
    </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>
<p>
    Furthermore, spreadsheet programs allow you to select a set of cells where you can extend the formula calculations
    down into other rows. And therefore, you can fill out a schedule pretty quickly, if you can recognize these duration
    patterns and apply the formulas.
</p>
<p>
    The problem comes in when the representation goes over midnight in some cases. In the following example, the TIME
    equations flow into the next day.
</p>
<table class="table table-bordered">
    <tbody>
    <tr>
        <th></th>
        <th>A</th>
        <th>B</th>
        <th>C</th>
        <th>D</th>
        <th>E</th>
        <th>F</th>
        <th>G</th>
        <th>H</th>
        <th>I</th>
        <th>J</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <th>8</th>
        <td>240</td>
        <td>MWF</td>
        <td>Nob Hill</td>
        <td>VID</td>
        <td>11:50:00 PM</td>
        <td>12:00:00 AM</td>
        <td>12:02:00 AM</td>
        <td>12:10:00 AM</td>
        <td></td>
        <td></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <th>9</th>
        <td>240</td>
        <td>MWF</td>
        <td>Nob Hill</td>
        <td>VID</td>
        <td>12:00:00 AM</td>
        <td>12:10:00 AM</td>
        <td>12:12:00 AM</td>
        <td>12:20:00 AM</td>
        <td></td>
        <td></td>
    </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>
<p>
    In line 8, when "11:50:00 PM" comes before "12:00:00 AM" in a horizontal line,
    the Busme! CSV compiler does some analysis. First, it wants to add 24 hours to "12:00:00 AM", because
    "12:00:00 AM" is temporally before "11:50:00 PM". However, just to make sure that is not a typographical
    error, the Busme! CSV compiler uses the path to calculate the average speed. It will issue a warning
    if the calculated speed doesn't seem feasible.  Therefore, the time in <em>minutes from midnight</em>
    for line 8. would be 1430, 1440, 1442, 1450.
</p>
<p>
    Temporal mistakes can happen due to typographical errors. For instance, given two cells with "11:19:00 AM"
    and "11:14:00 AM", where the second time should have been "11:24:00 AM" where the stops are 1 mile appart.
    The above situation applies and 24 hours is added to "11:14:00 AM" bring it to the next day.
    However, the analysis may issue a warning because that would constitute 1435 minutes to go 1 mile.
</p>
<p>
    Vertically is a bit trickier and only applies to the start time of the journey, i.e. first cell with
    in the journey line that contains a time. In the above example, between lines 8 and 9, Column E has the
    same situation, "11:50:00 PM" comes before "12:00:00 AM". Here the Busme! CSV Compiler just simply assumes that you
    are turning to the next day and adds 24 hours  because
    12:00:00 AM is temporally before "11:50:00 PM" in Column E. Therefore, the time in <em>minutes from midnight</em>
    for line 9. would be 1440, 1450, 1452, 1460.
</p>
<p>
    You must be careful in the vertical case because due to some cells being empty, The time is always compared
    to the first cell above the cell in question that is not empty. Therefore, it may be difficult to get a
    representation of that time, if it is indeed supposed to start on a time that should be 24 hours in advance.
    However, we see this case to be rare or non-existent.
</p>
<h4>Busme! CSV Compiler understands TIME formulas</h4>
<p>
    Some spreadsheet programs, such as newer versions of Libre Office Calc will allow you to write the
    formulas into the CSV file. The Busme! CSV compiler can parse simple arithmetic formulas with the
    TIME formula. Using the TIME formulas can eliminate ambiguities, as you may always add TIME(24,0,0)
    to a time.
</p>
<h4>Allowable Time Formats</h4>
