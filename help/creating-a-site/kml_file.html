<h1>Busme! KML Journey Pattern File</h1>
<p>
  KML is an XML based defacto standard for presenting or structuring geographic data. Special forms of a KML
  file may be used to present graphics, such as icons, lines, an polygons on a map. It is a general standard
  for structuring geographic data. Not every valid KML file is able to be used by whatever programs says that
  they accept KML files.
</p>
<p>
  Busme! uses a special structure of a KML file to represent a Journey Pattern. We present here the structure
  that we call a Busme! KML file, that can be fed into our Journey Builder Tool and our Busme! CSV Compiler.
</p>
<p>
  You may create your own Busme! KML files, which is a function that the Journey Builder tool does.
  For example, you may create a Busme! KML file with Google Earth by manual editing. This effort would be
  quite tedious, but we present this specification in case you have or create tools or scripts to
  create Busme! KML Journey Pattern Files.
</p>
<h2>Busme! Definitions</h2>
<p>We first present some terms that comprise a Journey Pattern in Busme!</p>
<dl>
  <dt>Journey Pattern</dt>
  <dd>
    A Journey Pattern is a sequence of Journey Pattern Links and Stop Points.
  </dd>
  <dt>Journey Pattern Link</dt>
  <dd>
    A Journey Pattern Link is a combination of a reference to two Stop Points and a geometry that connects
    a line between the two Stop Points.
  </dd>
  <dt>Stop Point</dt>
  <dd>
    A Stop Point is a combination of a name and a geographic location, i.e. longitude and latitude.
  </dd>

<h3>KML Mapping</h3>
<p>
  This section specifies the mapping of a Journey Pattern to its representative Busme! KML Structure.
</p>
<dl>
  <dt>Journey Pattern</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>
      A Journey Pattern is represented by a KML Folder that has a Name component, and a sequence of Placemarks.
      The Name Component for the Folder contains the word "Busme" and there must be at least 3 Placemarks.
    </p>
    <pre>
      &lt;kml xmlns='http://earth.google.com/kml/2.0'>
      &lt;Folder>
        &lt;name>Busme&lt;/name>
        &lt;Placemark id="sp_0">
        &lt;/Placemark>
        &lt;Placemark id="link_0">
        &lt;/Placemark>
        &lt;Placemark id="sp_1">
        &lt;/Placemark>
      &lt;/Folder>
    </pre>
    <p>
      The Placemarks are arranged in a sequence that represents Stop Point, Link, Stop Point, Link, Stop Point, and
      so on.
    </p>
  </dd>
  <dt>Stop Point</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>
      A Stop Point is represented by a Placemark that has a name component and a Point Geometry component.
    </p>
    <pre>
      &lt;Placemark id="sp_0">
        &lt;name>sp_0:30th St Station&lt;/name>
        &lt;point>
          &lt;coordinates>
           -75.182411, 39.954720
          &lt;/coordinates>
        &lt;/point>
      &lt;/Placemark>
    </pre>
    <p>
      Each Stop Point Placemark has an "id" attribute that specifies the place in the sequence of Stop Points
      in the Journey Pattern. The prefix of a Stop Point Placemark's id attribute is "sp_".
      The complete id attribute is the prefix followed by the cardinal sequence number of the stop, which
      means the first Stop Point's number is zero (0).
      A constraint is that the name component must contain the name of the Stop Point prefixed with its id attribute
      followed by a colon (:).
    </p>
    <p>
      The Point component follows the KML standard in that it must contain a Coordinates component that contains
      the longitude and latitude, in that order, separated by a comma (,).
    </p>
  </dd>
  <dt>Link</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>
      A Link is represented by a Placemark that has a name component and a LineString Geometry component.
    </p>
    <pre>
      &lt;Placemark id="link_0">
        &lt;name>link_0:&lt;/name>
        &lt;linestring>
          &lt;coordinates>
           -75.182411,39.954720 -75.182433,39.95443 -75.18253,39.95482
          &lt;/coordinates>
        &lt;/linestring>
      &lt;/Placemark>
    </pre>
    <p>
      Each Link Placemark has an "id" attribute that specifies the place in the sequence of Links in the Journey
      Pattern. The prefix of a Link Placemark's id attribute is "link_". The complete id attribute is the prefix
      followed by the cardinal sequence number of the link, which means the first Link's number is zero (0). A
      Placemark requires a name component, so a constraint is that the name component contains the id attribute
      followed by a colon (:).
    </p>
    <p>
      The Linestring component follows the KML standard in that it must contain a Coordinates component that
      contains a sequence of longitude, latitude pairs, in which longitude and latitude are separated by a comma (,),
      and the pairs are themselves separated by a white space character (i.e. space, new line, tab).
    </p>
  </dd>
</dl>
<p>
  The general constraints are that the Journey Pattern must have at least 2 Stop Point Placemarks and one
  Link Placemark.
</p>
<p>
  Further than that, there must be one more Stop Point Placemark than there are Link Placemarks
  in the Folder construct, and they must alternate Stop Point, Link, Stop Point, etc. The id attributes of the place
  marks must follow the following pattern, sp_0, link_0, sp_1, link_1, sp_2, link_2, sp_3, ......
</p>
<p>
  A Link Placemark with an id of link_<em>n</em> should draw a line between the coordinates of sp_<em>(n-1)</em>
  to sp_<em>n</em>. If it is not
  exact, the Busme! Journey Builder Tool and the Busme! CSV Compiler will add a connecting line from the coordinate
  of the Stop Point sp_<em>(n-1)</em> to the first longitude latitude pair of the Link, and will draw a
  connecting line from the last longitude latitude pair in the Link to the coordinate of Stop Point sp_<em>n</em>.
