<h1>Creating a Busme! Account</h1>
<p>
  Creating a Busme! user account is easy, and pretty familiar. We use an email to uniquely identify you to
  the Busme! system in all activities. This address will identify you in any of one or more of the
  particular roles you choose or for which you are authorized.
</p>
<p>
  You do not have to wait for a verification email. We are not sending them yet, but may have to in the
  future. Please remember your password.
</p>
<p>
  Just go to the <a href="/unified_user/sign_up">http://busme.us/unified_user/sign_up</a> link or the hyperlink
  called "Sign in" at the top right navigation. If you are at the "Sign in" page, go to the "Sign up" link below.
  Use your email and create a password that you will remember. And please use your real name especially if you
  are going to be a paying customer.

<h2>What your account is used for:</h2>
<p>
  Your account is used for one or more roles that you may have on the main Busme! site or on any Busme! Transit
  site that you or somebody else created. Each role has a specific purpose and different capabilities.
</p>
<h3>On the main Busme! site</h3>
<p>
  The main Busme! site is the portion of the site that deals with the "meta level". That is, our customers, advertisers,
  administrations, anything that involves multiple Busme! Transit sites. One the main Busme! site, the roles you may
  have are:
</p>
<dl>
  <dt>Customer/Owner</dt>
  <dd>
    If you are creating a Busme! Transit site, you are a known to the system as a Customer and
    you "own" the Busme Transit sites that you created. Initially you are allowed to create only 2 sites, unless you
    contact
    us and we approve you for more.
  </dd>
  <dt>Advertiser</dt>
  <dd>
    You may also sign up as an Advertiser, which will allow you place location based advertisements
    on our system. You must get approval to be an advertiser.
  </dd>
</dl>
<h3>On a particular Busme! Transit Site</h3>
<p>
  A Busme! Transit Site is a set of pages and backend system created by you for a particular transit system.
  Once you create a Busme! Transit Site, you immediately become a "Customer" and you have the following
  additional roles that are specific to the site you created.
</p>
<dl>
  <dt>Planner</dt>
  <dd>
    A Planner is allowed to create "Deployments" and "Networks" and compile the Busme! CSV Files or
    Google Transit Files (GTFS) to populate your site with fixed routes and journeys.
  </dd>
  <dt>Operator</dt>
  <dd>
    An Operator is allowed to select Deployments, which is the unit that comprises set of scheduled
    journeys to activate on your site. This allows an operator to quickly switch operations from such logical
    deployments such as "Normal Ops', "Snow Route Ops", etc.
  </dd>
  <dt>Super</dt>
  <dd>
    A Super is allowed to do issue/delete Operator, Planner, and Driver Roles from accounts.
  </dd>
  <dt>Driver</dt>
  <dd>
    A Driver is a special role that issued by the Super and by way of authorization codes given by the super
    that allows you to sign in as a Driver
    from the Busme! Mobile App. This role is used to distinguish you from regular passengers in that
    your word is worth more. That is, you might be actually driving the bus. So, your location is
    more accurate than say somebody who just stepped off the bus.
  </dd>
  <dt>User/Rider/Passenger</dt>
  <dd>
    The User is the basic role anyone has within your particular Busme! transit system. Your
    associated identity is used to report locations of buses from the Busme! Mobile App.
  </dd>
</dl>
