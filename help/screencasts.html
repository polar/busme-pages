      Transportation Site. The previous screencast covers creating a site, and this one explains the details a little
      further. It explains the top level of the Busme Data Model. The Busme Data Model is the terminology and structure
      of

      This screencast explains the Busme Data Model. The Busme Data Model is comprised of Deployments, Networks,
      Routes, Services, Journeys, Paths, Timing Links, and Stop Points. This screencast explains each component
      in a comprehensive manner so that you may understand the data that underlies the Busme Transportation
      Site and its bus schedules.

        5. Network Plan and Upload </a>
    </dt>
    <dd>
      This screencast explains in detail the administration of Deployments and Networks, which are the top level
      components of the Busme Data Model and the major manageable components of a Busme Transportation Site.
      It explains the top level composition of a Network Plan, and shows you how to upload a Network Plan to a Busme
      Transportation Site. Uploading a Network Plan to the site causes the plan to be processed, which in turn populates
      the Network with Route, Services, and Journeys.

        6. Anatomy of a Network Plan</a>
    </dt>
    <dd>
      This screencast explains the insides of a Network Plan. A Network Plan File is a ZIP file of a folder containing
      CSV files, each representing a Route Service. A Route Service is the definition of a part of a Route that is
      specific to a operational time frame and contains the time schedule definitions of all Journeys that follow one
      particular path. For the most part, it closely resembles a spreadsheet version of a bus schedule. A Comma
      Separated
      Values (CSV) file is a spreadsheet in text form. The screen cast explains the structure of the particular CSV
      files
      used for a Route Service definition, and ZIPS them up into a single plan file and uploads them to the Busme New
      Paltz administration site for processing.

    </dt>
    <dd>
      This screencast explains Busme's Journey Builder Tool. The purpose of the screen cast is to get you familiar
      enough
      to start creating Route Service CSV files for your Network Plan. It goes over some basic operations of the tool
      and
      shows you how to create a Busme Route Service CSV file complete with a graphical path of a bus journey through a
      number of bus stops.
