        As a transit system operator, would you like to let your customers know where your buses are in real time? If
        they can find the bus they want on their smart phone, do you think that would that increase your ridership?
      </p>

      <p>
        As a rider, would you like to know where the buses are in your town? Does your bus company not foster that
        capability on-line, or doesn't want to?
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="span4">
      Busme! can help you get that effort of the ground whether you are a transit operator, or a transit rider.
      The Busme! service lets you set up your own transportation site. This site gives you the ability to model and
      monitor your route based transport vehicles. You may monitor them with on your website, or with our Busme!
      Android App.

        <h2>What You Need</h2>
        <p>
          We supply the Busme! web service and Android application. You acquire all your own equipment. The good
          part is, the only equipment you need is a smart cell phone with Global Positioning System (GPS) location
          capability, which you may already have! You do need a wireless data plan for the phone, and, of course, you
          need wireless data/phone service in your area where the buses are traveling. Other than that, you are good
          to go.

          Getting Started
        </h2>
          <p>
            Getting started is relatively easy. You don't have to be a computer programmer or even a transportation
            expert, but you do need to have some computer skills. Essentially, you need to be able to drop and move
            icons around on a map and be able to use a basic spreadsheet program such as, MS Excel or LibreOffice Calc.
            You get started by clicking <a href="/websites/new">here</a>, create an account, and then create your
            very own Busme! transportation site!

        <h2>
          Busme is Social
        </h2>
        <p>
          Busme! has a great social component to it. For example, you have a transit system in your neighborhood,
          but the operator doesn't have Busme! or some other tracking system. No problem. The only piece of
          equipment you need is an Android Phone with GPS and a wireless data plan and somebody to be on the bus!
          That means, you don't have to be the driver, you can just be a
          passenger! If enough passengers play the game of reporting their locations while on the bus,
          then everybody gets to know where the bus is. It just takes a bit of effort from a concerted individual
          to draw the stops and routes, enter in the time data for the schedule spreadsheet, and push a few buttons.
