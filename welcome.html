  Welcome to Busme!

      As a transit system operator, would you like to let your customers know where your buses are in real time? If they
      can find the bus they want on their smart phone, do you think that would that increase your ridership?
    </p>

    <p>
      As a rider, would you like to know where the buses are in your town? Does your bus company not foster that
      capability on-line, or doesn't want to? Then you can do it yourself with Busme!
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="span4">
    Busme can help you get that effort of the ground. Our service lets you set up your own route based transportation
    site that lets you monitor your transport vehicles in a web browser or with our Android Phone App.

    We supply only the service, and you acquire all your own equipment and hardware. In fact, the only equipment you need
    is a smart cell phone with Global Positioning System (GPS) location capability, which you may already have! You do
    need a wireless data plan for the phone, and, of course, you need wireless data/phone service in your area.

<h2>
  Getting Started.
</h2>
<div>
  <p>
    Getting started is relatively easy. You don't have to be a computer programmer or even a transportation expert, but
    you do need to have some computer skills. Essentially, you need to be able to drop and move icons around on a map
    and be able to use a basic spreadsheet program such as, MS Excel or LibreOffice Calc.
  </p>
</div>
<h2>
  Please Excuse Our Looks
</h2>
<p>
  Busme is a really new concept. Although there are competitors out there that can get your systems on line, we provide
  a service to let you perform this function yourself, without great cost or special equipment. You draw your bus
  routes; you supply the stops and their times; and you deploy the application into a running state, and change
  service dates.
</p>
<p>
  This site and concept is <strong>very</strong> new and we'd like your experimentation and feedback on how to make it
  better. You save all your work on your local machines, so you may restore it. This may give you some confidence into
  our newish state. So, please start experimenting.
</p>
<h2>
  Busme is Social
</h2>
<p>
  Busme has a great hidden social component to it. For example, you have a transit system in your neighborhood, but the
  operator doesn't have Busme. No problem. The only piece of equipment you need is an Android Phone with GPS and a
  wireless data plan and somebody to be on the bus! That means, you don't have to be the driver, you can just be a
  rider! If enough riders play the game of reporting their locations while on the bus, then everybody gets to know where
  the bus is. It just takes a bit of effort from a concerted individual to draw the stops and routes, enter in the
  schedule data, and run the site.
