      There is nothing like a few screencasts to get you started with Busme. If the screen casts listed behind the link
      link below are followed in order, you should get enough of a feel and understanding of the Busme methodology
      to get your site up and running. Stay tuned for more. We will be constantly improving and adding more information.
